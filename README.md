# hello-world
Learning to use github ui.

I am Tanjima. I have a passion to learn and test things - anything! I have thirst to brainstorm about how to make human experience better - in terms of using anything! For example, when I am doing something in my kitchen, one part of my brain keeps thinking how could I have done it differently so it can be faster, intuitive, efficient and fun!

Same about my professional life - every places I have worked so far, I have constantly thought about how to do my work in way that is faster, intuitive, efficient and fun!

I think I will do a great job in a field where the thrive is to constatnt drive for experience improvement......I am working on it :)
